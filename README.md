# ulog

Just a simple snippet for Visual Studio. Just type ulog and hit tab to expand to UE_LOG(LogTemp, Display, TEXT("")).


To Install:

1) Download the snippet and save it wherever. By default Visual Studio creates "Documents/Visual Studio/Code Snippets/< Languages >/My Code Snippets". I would recommend "Documents/Visual Studio <Year>/Code Snippets/C++/My Code Snippets"

2) Open the Code Snippets Manager (Tools > Code Snippet Manager or Ctrl-K, Ctrl-B)

3) If the "My Code Snippets" folder is not listed, click Add and select it
